			<h2> Part 1 of 6: Making the Dough </h2>
					<ol>
						<img src="images/1.jpg">
						<li>
						<div id="one"></div>
					<h3> Keep everything cold. </h3>
						<p>If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven.
						</p>
						
							<ul> 
								<li> This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. </li>
								<li> A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. </li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<br>
							<img src="images/2.jpg">
				<li>
					<div id="two">	
					<h3> Always cream the butter and sugar. </h3>
						<p> If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always "cream" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 
						</p>	
				</li>
				<img src="images/3.jpg">
				<li>
					<div id="three">
					<h3> Try to use salted butter. </h3>
						<p> Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference.
						</p>
				</li>
				<img src="images/4.jpg">
				<li>
					<div id="four">
					<h3> Change the recipe to alter the final product.
					</h3>
					<p> If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but what a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li> Use cake flour, shortening instead of butter (or switch for part of the butter), or ~2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 4 teaspoons LESS flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, soft cookies. </li>
							<li> Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. </li>
							<li> Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. </li>
							<li> Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. </li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<br>
				<img src="images/5.jpg">
				<li>
					<div id="five">
					<h3>Weigh your ingredients.</h3>
						<p>If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie.</p>
				</li>

					<h3>Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even.</h3>If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough.
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="images/7.jpg">
					<div id=twob>
				<li><h3>Use Parchment Paper.</h3> Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie.
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="images/8.jpg">
					<div id=threeb>
				<li><h3>Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. </h3> <p> If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom!</p> 
					<img src="images/9.jpg">
					<div id=fourb>
				<li><h3>Know your oven.</h3><p>  Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. </p>
					<ul>
						<li> For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. </li>
					</ul>	
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="images/10.jpg">
					<div id=fiveb>
				<li> 	
					<h3> Start with a cold pan.</h3>
					<p> Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. </p>
					<ul>
						<li> This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too!
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="images/11.jpg">	
					<div id=sixb>
					<li> <h3>Don't over bake your cookies.</h3>
						<p> If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies.
							<ul>
								<li> If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily.
							</ul>
							<br>
							<br>
							<img src="images/12.jpg">
							<div id=sevenb>
							<li> <h3>Let cookies sit on the pan.</h3>
							<p> Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to eat.</p>

				<h3>Convert for vegans.</h3>
				<p> To convert almost any cookie recipe for a vegan diet, the main ingredients you'll have to worry about are the butter and the eggs. The butter is easily replaced with shortening (this often makes a better cookie anyway!) but if you want to avoid the awful egg substitute, try this instead. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Add 1 tbs of oil, 1 tbs of cornstarch, 2 tbs of soymilk and 1 tbs of ground flax seed in place of each egg called for in the recipe. If it calls for only yolks, go easy on the milk and oil.
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				<div id="twoc">
				<img src="images/14.jpg">
			<li>
				<h3>Convert for lactose intolerance.</h3> 
			<p>If someone has a bad lactose intolerance, you can easily replace the butter with shortening. Any milk called for can be replaced with lactose-free milk, soy milk or more exciting options like hazelnut milk!</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div id="threec">
			<img src="images/15.jpg">
			<li>
				<h3> Convert for peanut allergy. </h3>
			<p> If someone has a peanut allergy, you can replace ingredients like peanut butter with almond butter or Nutella (yum!). Just make sure that no other ingredients have had contact with the peanut butter.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Make sure, for example, no one has EVER used a knife to get some peanut butter out of a jar and then used that same knife to get some Nutella without cleaning in between. To be safe, get a new jar.
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div id="fourc">
			<img src="images/16.jpg">
			<li> 
				<h3> Convert for gluten allergy. </h3>
			<p> Replacing flour in recipes is easy, but you have to keep a few things in mind. For things like cookies, you'll want to err on the low-protein side, since you want them to be soft. You also want to mix different types of wheat flour substitutes. When using these substitutes, it is also necessary to add a slightly larger amount of liquid. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div id="fivec">
			<img src="images/17.jpg">
			<li>
				<h3>Convert for diabetics</h3>
			<p>This is tricky, since it's the carbs as much as the sugar which causes the problem for diabetics. Try to make protein heavy cookies (like peanut butter cookies with high-protein alternative flours instead of normal flour) and switch the sugar with some Splenda or other sugar alternative (honey is good!).</p>
