		<h2> Part 1 of 6: Making the Dough </h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<div id="one"><img src="images/1.jpg"></div>
					<h4> Keep everything cold. </h4>
						<p>If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven.
						</p>
						
							<ul> 
								<li> This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. </li>
								<li> A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. </li>
							</ul>
				<li>
					<div id="two"><img src="images/2.jpg">	
					<h4> Always cream the butter and sugar. </h4>
						<p> If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always "cream" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 
						</p>	
				</li>
				<li>
					<div id="three"><img src="images/3.jpg">
					<h4> Try to use salted butter. </h4>
						<p> Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference.
						</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div id="four"><img src="images/4.jpg">
					<h4> Change the recipe to alter the final product.
					</h4>
					<p> If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but what a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li> Use cake flour, shortening instead of butter (or switch for part of the butter), or ~2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 4 teaspoons LESS flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, soft cookies. </li>
							<li> Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. </li>
							<li> Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. </li>
							<li> Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. </li>
						</ul>
				<li>
					<div id="five"><img src="images/5.jpg">
					<h4>Weigh your ingredients.</h4>
						<p>If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie.</p>
				</li>
